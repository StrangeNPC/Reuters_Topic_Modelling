# Marketing Data Project

This dataset contains marketing data from a tech company aimed at converting individuals to purchase financial products. The data is privately sourced from the tech company itself and is NOT public.

The main goal is to perform analysis on factors such as Age, Job Occupation, Marketing Success, Bank account balances and determine which of the key areas should be targetted and insights gained to further push for higher and faster conversion rate of customers.


The main steps are as follows:

0. Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
2. One-hot Encoding
3. Train-Test-Split
4. Model Training
5. Parameter Tuning
6. Coalition game-theory/SHAP library for most important features

You may refer to the Powerpoint slides (pptx) file for the full slide deck.
