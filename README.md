The main goal is to perform experimentation on topic modelling on it as a substitute for chatbot history. This is done to determine the feasibility of topic modelling methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).


The main steps are as follows:

0. Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
2. Model Training
